Logitech PUBG Macro Adaptation based on Liantian-cn and Red-ington's scripts for my personal use.
I use 6x UMP or 4x UMP so any other recoil table is useless for me. I don't check them neither would I have the desire to change them.
The balance team at Blueballs don't really understand how op UMP is despite the fact that Shroud mentions this every other week so I guess it works out for me.
